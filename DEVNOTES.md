//I had quite a difficult time with this project, I ran into git issues and was able to understand the git tree better thanks to Dan and Ray, I learned a lot from this project. Last night I had finished and today when I was testing my routes I ran into unexpected errors. I still have one error at the 'set-token-cookie' route that I just cant seem to figure out. I've spent most of the morning trying to fix this and a few other errors/typos I made along the way. I was hoping to recieve insight on why this error is giving me such a hard time, Ive re-read most of the phases several times now word for word. I even restarted the project but realized it would take too long to catch up. Thank you for your time!
